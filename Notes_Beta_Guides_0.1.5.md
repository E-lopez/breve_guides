## Layout Modifications

Previous layout changed comunication codes from main buttons to feedback buttons, which appear just as
information chunks.

Changed the latter to make them evident buttons. 


### Cores Component

Added title "Ag√©ndate" and explanation note above and below the `individual` and `double` buttons.


### Feedback Component

Changed buttons style to make them evident to be interactive. Changed each one lay-out from `column` to `row`, and replace icons te reduce color saturation.

Added `color` property in `data` obeject `feedbackChunks` to give a different one to each button:

Strengths "#4682B4"
Oportunities "#537A9A"
Resources "#4D6171"

### Main Header

### Data Manager CalculateDistance

Using Haversine formula. Error calculating Arc:

Before  
var Arc = pow(sin(deltaOne/2), 2) + cos(thetaUsr) * cos(thetaGd) * sin(deltaTwo/2)

Correction
  var Arc = pow(sin(deltaOne/2), 2) + cos(thetaUsr)  *cos(thetaGd) * pow(sin(deltaTwo/2), 2)
